I am currently conducting postdoctoral research at the Centre for Sustainable Asian Cities, National University of Singapore, under the supervision of Prof. [HENG Chye Kiang](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/arch/staffs/heng-chye-kiang-dr/). I obtained my PhD degree from the School of Architecture, Tsinghua University, supervised by Prof. [ZHUANG Weimin](https://www.arch.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/FArchitecture/1744). During my PhD, I was a visiting PhD student at the National University of Singapore under the supervision of Dr. [ZHANG Ye](https://www.arch.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/FArchitecture/2532). I received my Bachelor of Architecture degree from the School of Architecture, Tsinghua University.

I previously worked as an architectural intern at [THAD](https://www.thad.com.cn/) and [Jiakun Architects](http://www.jiakun.com/), where I contributed to the design of several large-scale public building projects and design competitions.


Research Interest
------
My research interests focus on integrating empirical and theoretical approaches to the improvement of urban and architectural spaces to support user-centered and responsive design decisions.

  * **Data-Driven Evaluation of Urban Residential Spaces:** developing algorithmic frameworks and models based on multi-source urban data to support residential space evaluation, inform design and policy decisions, and advance sustainable and equitable urban renewal.

  * **Urban Spatial Design and Residents' Perceptions and Behaviors:** examining how users perceive and interact with urban spaces through empirical studies, and identifying design-related factors to support more responsive and evidence-informed design strategies.

  * **Programming and Post-Occupancy Evaluation in Architecture and Urban Design:** advancing the development of theories and methods related to pre-design programming and post-occupancy evaluation, to support more well-informed practices across the full life cycle.
