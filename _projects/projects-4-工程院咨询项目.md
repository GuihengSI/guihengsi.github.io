------
This project is a policy consultation project commissioned by the Chinese Academy of Engineering, with Prof. Weimin ZHUANG as the Principal Investigator. It explores the extension of post-occupancy evaluation (POE) methodologies from the micro scale of individual buildings to the meso-scale of urban space, and their integration with macro-level urban evaluation systems, thereby establishing a coherent framework.
